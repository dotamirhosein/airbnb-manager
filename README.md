# 🏠 Airbnb Manager

A small tool I built to manage properties, guests, and bookings 
started as a CLI, grew into a web dashboard.

## What it does
- Add & view properties and guests
- Book properties (with conflict detection)
- Reports: income, bookings per property, monthly breakdown

## Run it
```bash
# Web
streamlit run app.py

# CLI
python main.py
